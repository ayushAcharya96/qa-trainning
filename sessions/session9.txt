Use case, Test Scenario and Test Case
--------------------------------------
Use Case:
---------
    - Use case describes the requirement
    - Use case contains THREE items
        - Actor, which is the user, which can be a single person or a group of people, interacting with a process.
        - Action, which is to reach the final outcome.
        - Goal/Outcome, which is the successful user outcome.

Test Scenario:
--------------
    - A possible area to be tested (What to test)

Test Case:
----------
    - Step by step actions to be performed to validate functionality (How to test)
    - Test case contains test steps, expected result and actual result.

Use Case vs Test Case
----------------------
Use Case
----------
    - Describes functional requirement, prepared by Business Analyst

- Test Case
-------------
    - Describes Test Steps/ Procedure, prepared by Test Engineer

Test Scenario vs Test Case
---------------------------
- Test Scenario is “What to be tested”, and Test Case is “How to be tested”

- example
    - Test Scenario: Checking the functionality of Login button
        - TC1: Click the button without entering username and password
        - TC2: Click the button only entering Username
        - TC3: click the button while entering wrong user name and wrong password
