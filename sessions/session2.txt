SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
--------------------------------------
Software Development Life Cycle is a process used by software industry to design, develop and test softwares.

3 pillors of company
    P - People
    P - Process
    P - Product

Phases of SDLC:
planning--->Requirement Analysis--->Design--->Development--->Testing---->Deployment--->Maintenance

Models of SDLC (Process Model):
-------------------------------

Waterfall Model:
----------------
    RA:
        Documentation Phases
        produces SRS Document
    Design:
        based on SRS document, Design document is created
    Implementation:
        coding is done with reference to design document
    Testing:
        Software is tested
    Deployment:
        Tested Software is deployed
    Maintenance:
        Deployed software is maintained if any changes is required.

old and traditional Model

advantages:
    1. Quality of the product will be good. (Every phase has detailed document.)
    2. Since Requirement changes are not allowed, chances of finding bugs will be less.
    3. Initial investment is less since the testers are hired at later stage.
    4. Preferred for small projects since the requirements are freezed.

drawbacks:
    1. Requirement changes are not allowed.
    2. If there is defect in requirement that will be continued in later phases.
    3. Total investment is more because time taking for rework on defect is time consuming which leads to high investment.
    4. Testing will start only after coding.


Spiral Model (Iterative Model):
-------------------------------
1. Spiral Model is iterative model.
2. Spiral Model overcome drawbacks of Waterfall model.
3. We follow spiral model whenever there is dependency on the modules.
4. In every cycle new software will be released to customer.
5. Software will be released in multiple versions. So it is also called version control model.

Advangates of spiral model:
---------------------------
    1. Testing is done in every cycle before going to the next cycle.
    2. Customer will get to use software for every module.
    3. Requirement changes are allowed after every cycle before going to the next cycle.

Disadvantages of spiral model:
------------------------------
    1. Requirement changes are not allowed in between the cycle.
    2. Every cycle of spiral model looks like Waterfall model.
    3. There is no testing in requirement and design phase.


Prototype model:
----------------
Initial requirement from the customer--->Prototype---->Customer--->design, coding, testing....


V-V Model (V Model):
--------------------
Software will be divided into modules
    EG: for gmail
        modules can be login, send email

Testing is done is every step.

Verification
------------
    - BRS/CRS/URS 
    - SRS
    - HLD (High Level Design)
    - LLD (Low Level Design)
    - Coding

Validation
----------
    - Unit Testing
    - Integration Testing
    - System Testing
    - User Acceptance Testing
    
    
Static Testing:
---------------
Testing project related documents is called as static testing.

    Review
    Walkthrough
    Inspection

Dynamic Testing:
----------------
Testing the actual software.

    White Box Testing
        - Unit Testing
        - Integrated Testing
    Black Box Testing
        - System Testing
        - UAT Testing


Verification
------------
- Verification checks whether we are building the right product
- Focus on Documentation

Static testing techniques are used for verification.
- Reviews
- Walkthrough
- Inspection


Validation
----------
- Validation checks whether we are building the product right
- Takes place after verifiations are completed
- Focus on Software
- Validation typically involves actual testing
- Unit testing, integration, system testing, UAT Testing


Dynamic testing techniques are used for Validation

    White Box Testing
        - Unit Testing
        - Integrated Testing
    Black Box Testing
        - System Testing
        - UAT Testing

Advantages:
-----------
    - Testing is involved in every step.

Disadvantages:
--------------
    - Documentation is more.
    - Initial investment is more.

Static Testing:
---------------
Testing project related documents is called as static testing.

Review:
-------
    Conducts on documents to encure correctness and completeness

    Types:
        - requirements Reviews
        - Design Reviews
        - Code Reviews
        - Test plan Reviews
        - Test cases Reviews

Walkthrough: (discussion with peers)
------------------------------------
- It is a informal reveiw.
- Author reads the documents or code and discuss with peers.
- It's not pre-planned and can be done whenever required.
- Also Walkthrough does not have minutes of the meet.

Inspection
----------
- Its a most formal review.
- In which at least 3-6 people will sit in the meeting.
    1. reader (auther of the document)
    2. writer (note down questions and clarification discussed in the meeting) 
    3. moderator (organizer of the meeting) 
    plus concerned
- Inspection will have a proper schedule which will be intimated via email to the concerned developer/tester.
