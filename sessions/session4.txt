System Testing
--------------
Done in tester environment (replica of customer environment)
    - qa environment, qc environment, staging environment
    - GUI Testing
    - Usability Testing
    - Functional Testing
    - Non-Functional Testing

GUI Testing
------------
- testing the user interface of an application
- tests elements of UI
    - checkboxes, input field, scrollbars, images, colors, sizes, icons, menus, buttons

GUI Testing Checklist
---------------------
- Testing the size, position, width, height of the elements.
- Testing of the error messages that are getting displayed.
- Testing the different sections of the screen.
- Testing of the font whether it is readable or not.
- Testing of the screen in different resolutions with the help of zooming in and zooming out.
- Testing the alignment of the texts and other elements like icons, buttons, etc. are in  proper or not.
- Testing the colors of the fonts.
- Testing whether the image has good clarity or not.
- Testing the alignment of the images.
- Testing of the spelling.
- The user must most not get frustrated while using the system interface.
- Testing whether the interface is attractive or not.
- Testing of the scrollbars according to the size of the page if any.
- Testing of the disabled fields if any.
- Testing of the size of the images.
- Testing of the headings whether it is properly aligned or not.
- Testing of the color of the hyperlink.
- Testing UI Elements like button, textbox, text area, check box, radio buttons, drop downs, links etc.


Usability Testing
-----------------
(provides user manuals / help menu)
- During this testing validates application provided context sensitive help or not to the user.
- Checks how easily the end users are able to understand and operate the application is called usability testing.


Functional Testing
-------------------
- functionality is noting but behavior fo application.
- Functional Testing talks about how your feature should work.


- Object Properties Testing
- Database Testing
- Error Handling
- Calculations/Manipulations Testing
- Links Existence and Links Execution
- Cookies and sessions

Object Properties Testing
-------------------------
Check the properties of objects present on the Application.

EG: in Textbox properties are enabled and disabled
    selection of one radio button at a time
    selection of one item in dropdown
    selection of multiple item in list boxes
    change of focus to next input after insertion of text in a text box

Database Testing (Backend Testing)
----------------------------------
(Require some sql commands)
(huge testing step)

As a tester we focus on DML operations

At the beginning, verify the required data in coming to UI. 

DML (Data Manipulations Language)
---------------------------------
Create, Read, Update, Delete

Work on UI, and verify data in Database

Database testing includes both white box testing and black box testing.
Also called Grey box testing. (Asked in interviews)

Apart from this 
    table and column level validation is also done.
        Column Type, column length, number of columns....
    Relation between the tables ( Normalizations)
    Functions
    Procudures
    Triggers
    Indexes
    Views
    etc....

Done by database experts

Error Handling Testing
-----------------------
- Tester verify the error messages while performing the incorrect actions on the application.
- Error messages should be readable.
- User understandable language./Simple language.


Calculations/Manipulations Testing:
-----------------------------------
- Tester should verify the calculations.


Links Existence and Links Execution
------------------------------------
- where exactly the links are placed --------- Links Existence
- Links are navigating to proper page or not.

Internal Links
    - navigate to same page to different sections
External Links
    - navigate to different page
Broken Links
    - doesnot have any target page

Cookies and Sessions
---------------------
Cookies - Temporary files created by browser while browsing the pages through internet.

Sessions are time slots created by the server. Session will be expired after some time (If you are idle for some time)

cookies are created at brower side.
sessions are created at server side.

auto logout if application is not used.
used for security machanism.

Non Functional Testing
-----------------------
- Done once application is functionally stable.
- Focus on performance, load it can take and security etc.
Mainly tested as per customer expectation

    - Performance Testing --- speed of the application
        - Load Testing
        - Stress Testing
        - Volume Testing
    - Security Testing
    - Recovery Testing
    - Compatibility Testing
    - Configuration Testing
    - Installation Testing
    - Sanitation/Garbage Testing

- Performance Testing --- speed of the application
    (done on web based application)
    - Load: Increasing the load on the application slowly then check the speed of the application.
    - Stress: suddenly increase/decrease the load on the application and check the speed of the application
    - Volume: Check how much data is able to handle by the application

- Security Testing:
    - How secure our application
    - mainly focus on Authentication and Authorization

    - Authentication ----> User are valid or not
    - Authorization/Access Control ---> permissions of the valid user.

    other testing used pen testing, data communication, protocal testing, hacking will be done by security team.


- Recovery Testing:
    - checks the system change to abnormal to normal.


- Compatibility Testing:
    - Forward Compatibility
    - Backward Compatibility
    - Hardware Compatibility (Configuration Testing)

- Installation Testing:
    - Check screens are clear to understand or not.
    - Screens navigation
    - Simple or not.
    - Uninstallation 

- Sanitation/Garbage Testing:
    - Extra features not mentioned in requirement is also bug and should be removed.
