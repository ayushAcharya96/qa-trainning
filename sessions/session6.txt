Test Design Techniques / Test Case Design Techniques / Test Data Design Techniques
------------------------------------------------------------    
- used to prepare data for testing.
- helps to design better cases.

- Reduce Data
- Increase Coverage 

Types of test design techniques
--------------------------------
1. Equivalance Class Partitioning (ECP)
2. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
3. Decision Table based testing
4. State Transition
5. Error Guessing


Equivalance Class Partitioning (BVA)
-------------------------------
- Partition data into various classes and we can select data according to class then test. It reduce the number of test-cases and saves time for testing.

value check
clasify/divide/Partition the data into multiple classes


Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
------------------------------
- BVA technique used to check Boundaries of the input.

Test with these parameters
    - min 
    - min + 1
    - min - 1
    - max 
    - max + 1
    - max - 1


Input domain testing
---------------------
- The value will be verified in the text box/input fields.
- We use ECP and BVA



Decision Table
---------------
- Decision Table is also called as Cause-Effect Table.
- This technique will be used if we have more conditions and corresponding actions.
- In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of input.
- To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and action.

Example:
    - Take an example of transferring money online to an account which is already added and approved.

    - Here the conditions to transfer money are:
        - Account already approved
        - OTP (one time password) matched
        - Sufficient money in the account
    
    - And the actions performed are
        - Transfer money
        - Show a message as insufficient amount
        - Block the transaction incase of suspicious transaction


State Transition
-----------------
- In state transition changes in input condtions changes the state of the application.
- This testing technique allows the tester to test the behaviour of an AUT.
- The tester can perform this action by entering various input conditions in a sequence.
- In state transition technique, the testing team provides positive as well as negative input test values for evaluating the system behavior.

- Take an example of login page of an application which locks the user name after three wrong attempts of password.

Error Guessing
--------------
- Error guessing is one of the testing techniques used to find bugs in a software application based on tester's prior experience.
- In error guessing we don't follow any specific rules.
- It depends on Tester Analytical skills and experience.
- Some of the examples are:
    - Submitting a form without entering values.
    - Enter invalid values such as entering alphabets in the numeric field.
