Steps in STLC
--------------
1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Design
4. Test Execution
5. Defect Reporting / Bug Reporting
6. Test Closure


Requirement Analysis
--------------------
- project requirement Analysis


Test Planning
--------------
- mostly management level Planning

Phases
    - What to Test
    - How to test 
    - When to test

Input
    - project Plan
    - functional requirement

Activities
    - Identify the resources
        human resources, devices, environment
    - Team formation
        no of members required
        team hierarchy
    - Test estimation
    - Preparation of Test Plan
    - reviews on Test Plan
    - test plan sign-off

Responsibility
    - Test Lead / Team Lead (70%)
    - Test Manager (30%)

outcome
    - Test plan Document


Test Designing
--------------
- major activity is writing the test cases
- writing test cases is main resposibility of test engineers

Phases
    - test cases writing

Input
    - project Plan
    - functional requirement
    - test Plan
    - design docs
    - use cases

Activities
    - preparation of test scenarios
        - what to test
        - features to test
        - test conditions
    - preparation of test cases
        - step by step action to test the test scenarios
    - reviews on test cases
        - testing of test cases Document
    - traceability matrix (RTM)
        - mapping of requirement and corresponding test cases
    - test cases sign off
        - everyone's approval for test cases

Responsibility
    - Test lead/ team lead (30%)
    - Test Engineers (70%)

outcome
    - Test cases Document
    - traceability matrix


Test Execution
---------------

Input
    - Functional Requirement
    - Test Plan
    - Test cases
    - Build from development team

Activities
    - Executing test cases
    - Preparation of test report / Test Log
    - Identify Defects

Responsibility
    - Test Lead / Team Lead (10%)
    - Test Engineers (90%)

outcome
    - Status / Test Reports


Defect Reporting and Tracking
------------------------------

Input
    - Test cases
    - Test Report

Activities
    - Preparation of defect report
    - reporting defects to developers

Responsibility
    - Test Lead / Team Lead (10%)
    - Test Engineers (90%)

outcome
    - defect Reports


Test Closure/ Signoff
----------------------

Input
    - Test Reports
    - Defect Reports

Activities
    - Analyzing Test Reports
    - Analyzing Bug Reports
    - Evaluating Exit Criteria 
        - depends on company
        - p1, p2, p3 ---> 
            p1 --> major bugs (affects of business logic)
            p2 ---> medium priority bugs
            p3 ---> minor bugs (doesnot affect the business logic)

outcome
    - Test Summary Reports
